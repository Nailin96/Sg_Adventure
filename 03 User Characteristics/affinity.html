			<h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
			<div class="container_text">
				We surveyed 30 people from different age groups to get an understanding of the difficulties they faced in planning their trip to Singapore and their needs to have some entertainment during flight. With that, we made an affinity diagram based on the feedback we received. We categorised the responses according to their Quality Attributes and further categorised these attributes into design goals.
