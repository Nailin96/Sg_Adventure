				Since SGadventure is just a small game, we do not want it to be expensive for travellers to purchase. Hence, it is important to keep the price low. From the affinity diagram, we notice that many travellers think guide-book style of planning is very boring and they want something interesting for them to learn about their destinations. Hence,it is important to incorporate a fun factor into our game that would spur their interest to learn. Furthermore, we want to make this game easy to play as it may be tiring playing games on plane and people may not want to play complicated game on plane. Next, we think it is necessary to increase the fleasibility of our game as players need to bring it on plane. Last but not the least, since this is an education game, we are more focused on the learning values that the game has to offer. As such, we decided to allocate greater importance to both the fun factor and learning values when coming up with the game.

				Learning value would be how well the game can fulfill the goals set out in the affinity diagram. These include making it fun for travelers to plan their trip, teaching more than what is listed in a travel guide-book, making planning and memorizing easier, making friends to be actively involved in planning and allowing users to play this on plane.
